Lightweight PHP/Laravel toolkit designed to auto-generate all essential application files from entity configurations stored in [JSON files](stubs/samples/inventory.json). It streamlines tasks like database seeding and realistic data generation using Faker, making it perfect for testing, prototyping, and automation.

With Magic, you can build full-featured Laravel applications directly from configuration files, eliminating repetitive boilerplate and speeding up development.

![magic-demo.svg](magic-demo.svg)

## Quick Start

1. Create a new Laravel project (if you don't have one already):

```bash
laravel new my-magic-app
```

- Choose Vue starter when prompted.
- Choose Laravel's built-in authentication when prompted.
- Choose Pest for testing when prompted.
- Allow Laravel to install the necessary packages when prompted.

2. Navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd my-magic-app
```

3. Install the Magic package via Composer:

```bash
composer require glugox/magic
```
4. Publish the configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Glugox\Magic\MagicServiceProvider"
```

5. For quick start Magic has some demo samples which are just json configuration files located in the `stubs/samples` directory. You can use one of these samples to quickly set up your application.
To list all available samples, you can run:

```bash 
php artisan magic:list-samples
```

6. Run the magic build command with your chosen sample or your own configuration file:

```bash
php artisan magic:build --starter=inventory
```

7. If you have your own json configuration file, you can run:

```bash
php artisan magic:build --config=path/to/your/config.json
```

To see how to create your own configuration file, check the [sample configurations](./stubs/samples) directory.


8. Start your application:

```bash
npm run dev && php artisan serve
```
